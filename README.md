# chess
## A basic GUI chess game written in python

Note:
Chess images come from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#Setup)

For simplicity, we promote pawn to queen when promotion occurs rather than to make a choice between knight, rook, queen and bishop. (You can use a popup messagebox to make a selection as well)

This program is tested using conda python3.8 environment. The default python3 in macOS doesn't work.

To run the program, run "python3 Gamelogic.py" in command line. If there are any errors, please contact me.
