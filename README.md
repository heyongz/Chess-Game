# chess
### A basic GUI chess game written in python
##### Chess images come from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#Setup)
##### I'm new to chess. If there are any errors, please contact me.

Note:
For simplicity, we promote pawn to queen when promotion occurs rather than to make a choice between knight, rook, queen and bishop. (You can use a popup messagebox to make a selection)

This program is tested using conda python3.8 environment.
GUI part needs to use tkinter, the default python3 environment in macOS doesn't work.

To run the program, run "python3 Gamelogic.py" in command line
